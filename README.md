Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a **Full Stack Engineer** with a deep love for creating sleek, accessible, and high-performance web applications. I have a thing for design systems & tokens, cutting-edge web tech, and making the web a better place for everyone.

When I'm not coding, you can catch me on a skateboard 🛹, surfing 🌊, or eating pizza at the italian place around the corner 🍕

## 🌟 What I Do

- **Code Crafting**: I develop applications using mostly JavaScript, TypeScript, and React. Recently, I've been exploring SvelteKit as well.
- **Design Systems & Tokens**: Creating reusable, scalable components with consistent design tokens is my jam—because a unified visual language makes the web a more beautiful and accessible place.
- **Accessibility Advocate**: I give my best to make sure everyone, no matter their abilities, has access to the web.

## 🔧 Tools I Love

- **Languages**: TypeScript, HTML/CSS
- **Frameworks**: React, SvelteKit, AWS CDK
- **Design**: Figma, Storybook
- **Cloud**: AWS
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline
