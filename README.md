Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a **Full Stack Engineer** with a deep love for creating sleek, accessible, and high-performance web applications. I have a thing for design systems & tokens, cutting-edge web tech, and making the web a better place for everyone.

When I'm not coding, you can catch me on a skateboard 🛹, surfing 🌊, or eating pizza at the italian place around the corner 🍕

### 🌟 What I Do

- **Code Crafting**: I turn ideas into reality with JavaScript, TypeScript, and React. I also love playing around with SvelteKit lately.
- **Design Systems & Tokens**: Creating reusable, scalable components with consistent design tokens is my jam—because a unified visual language makes the web a more beautiful and accessible place.
- **Accessibility Advocate**: I make sure everyone, no matter their abilities, has access to the web.

### 🔧 Tools I Love

- **Languages**: JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML/CSS
- **Frameworks**: React, Next.js, SvelteKit
- **Design**: Figma, Storybook
- **Cloud**: AWS
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

### 💻 Cool Projects

#### [AI Nutrition Extractor](https://github.com/timges/ai-nutrition-extractor)

A web app that uses AI to pull out nutrition facts from recipes. Because who doesn't love knowing what they're eating?

#### [My Personal Website](https://tim-gesemann.dev)

A little corner of the web where I showcase what I’m working on. Built with SvelteKit, it’s fast and sleek—just like my code! 💻✨
